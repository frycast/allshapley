# All Shapley (experimental)
An experimental mixture of Shapley value utilities in various languages.

This repository is going to be confusing for anyone snooping around. Useful things created here will be cleaned up and moved to [frycast/shapley.jl](https://github.com/frycast/shapley.jl) (for Julia code), [frycast/pyshapley](https://github.com/frycast/pyshapley) (for Python code), or [frycast/rshapley](https://github.com/frycast/rshapley) (for R code).
