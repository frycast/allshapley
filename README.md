# All Shapley (experimental)
An experimental mixture of Shapley value utilities in various languages.

This repository is going to be confusing for anyone snooping around. Some of the things created here will be moved to [frycast/shapley.jl](https://github.com/frycast/shapley.jl) (for Julia code), [frycast/pyshapley](https://github.com/frycast/pyshapley) (for Python code), or [frycast/rshapley](https://github.com/frycast/rshapley) (for R code).
